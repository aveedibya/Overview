# LP Quarterly Letters

We are trying something different here, publishing the letters we send to our LPs each quarter.

Each quarter, we circulate a variety of updates and thoughts to our fund's investors. We break them down into three sections:
1. The Front Line
2. The Portfolio
3. The Finish Line

Because it would be inappropriate to share the specific performance updates of Starting Line's portfolio, we are only publishing the first section, "The Front Line." Our hope is that it provides some additional insight into the trends we're following and how we think.

## Q3 2018

**ON SHADOW MARKETS**

Consensus opinion has long suggested that the best investments are made by betting into large addressable markets; as the logic goes, they offer known and provable demand, and, as the back of the envelope math goes, even capturing a tiny 1% of a $100 billion market yields the ever illusive billion dollar company. 

Except that the aforementioned consensus is at best imprecise, and at worst, simply wrong.

Good companies are built into large markets. Extraordinary companies are built into markets that don’t yet exist. But could. And should.

“Could” and “should” is where we spend the majority of our time discovering and identifying opportunities for Starting Line. I’m deeply proud that many of our early investments had functionally no addressable market to speak of – as of a year ago (a) the market for video shout-outs didn’t exist for Cameo (b) the market for cryptocurrency collateralized loans didn’t exist for Unchained (c) [redacted], and the list goes on. In the past six months, we’ve seen the market for personalized video messages from celebrities grow substantially; it’s my hope that markets for our other early investments similarly materialize.

Smart money appears to share conviction that this is not a delusional approach. In a 2015 interview as part of [Linkedin’s Speaker Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3mBM4FelZs), Benchmark Capital General Partner Matt Cohler noted the following:

>“What I don’t look for in investments: a lot of entrepreneurs talk about ‘big markets,’ and if anything, I think a big market is a bit of a red flag. Because if something is really a big market, it’s probably going to be pretty hard for you, this underfunded startup, to get into any sort of position of strength in that market. You’re going to be one of a bunch of fish swimming in this giant ocean and there’s probably a bunch of sharks and boats there too and it’s going to be very hard to thrive. 

>I actually much prefer things that look like small markets, but that you can look at and say, imagine what the intersection of this entrepreneur and this product and this model, imagine what it could do to change and reshape this market. A textbook case from the generation we’re in is Uber where early on a lot of people looked at Uber and said: well, how big can that really be? Taxis and limos? That’s nice.

>Uber has radically changed and reshaped the way people think about transportation along with a lot of other things. So that’s the type of opportunity where you can imagine a future where you’ve grown and changed and reshaped the market, that’s far more exciting to me by far than a big market.”

Danny Rimer, General Partner of Index Ventures, whose firm over the past few years has grown from a relatively obscure European fund into a must-visit SF early stage firm (Dropbox, Slack, Bird, Farfetch, Discord), shares this belief around small or non-existent markets. From a [recent, 2018 interview:](http://www.thetwentyminutevc.com/dannyrimer/)

>“As much as Amazon is well positioned on the mainstream, when it comes to niches, we think that Amazon is not particularly well positioned to go after it. Part of it is because you’ve seen the service and what they’re trying to do and they’re really just trying to capture the main populace that is going to be online with more generic product that you need on a day to day basis. When it comes to areas of passion and cult following, that’s not something that Amazon focuses on.

>I think that if there’s something we’ve gotten wrong repeatedly, it’s to underestimate the sizing of specific niches. What we tend to forget is that when you’re connecting most of the world’s population, there are going to be niches that just explode in size as a result of having everyone that’s interested in that particular area connected. And so if we’d really thought about market sizes, we probably wouldn’t have done some of the best investments we’ve ever done.

>I’ll never forget investing in Etsy and folks saying that’s crazy – they’re already 250,000 merchants online, all these arts and craft stores, how many more can there be? Well, I think we’re at 3 million and counting. So Etsy’s the perfect example of how niches can explode into much larger opportunities when you connect them online.”

Matt and Danny are actually making two nuanced points across a similar theme; Matt, that underdeveloped (and seemingly small) markets can quickly materialize when matched with the right product/model, and Danny, that consumer niches which instinctively seem “non venture scale,” can frequently become venture scale as they proliferate. But the takeaway from both is similar: make contrarian bets on the categories that others deem to be uninteresting. 

This aligns with a statement I recently heard from Benchmark Capital General Partner Bill Gurley: “false negative is where all the pain is in this industry.” Specifically, that passing on a deal that ultimately returns 100x, due to lack of imagination, is the cardinal sin of any fund manager. Gurley considers himself a student of Matt Ridley, author of The Rational Optimist, forcing himself to always ask: what could go right?

I can’t promise that we will always get it right at Starting Line. But I can promise that we will always ask ourselves that same question: what could go right?

**THE HYBRID FUND OF THE FUTURE**

A mere seven months ago, I tweeted the following:

 

In retrospect, I was embarrassingly wrong. 

If you’re curious, here’s what Buffet had to say in the attached video: 

>“I would say there’s no one here that can understand some new internet company. I said at the annual meeting this year that if I were teaching at business school, on the final exam I would pass out the information on an internet company and ask each student to value it…and anyone that gave me an answer, I’d flunk. 

>I don’t know how to do it…but people do it every day. It’s more exciting. If you look at it like going out to the races that’s one thing, but if you’re investing – investing is putting out money to be sure of getting more money back later at an appropriate rate. And to do that, you need to understand what you’re doing it in, you need to understand the business. And you can understand some businesses, but not all of them.”

Buffet is one of my heroes – brilliant, articulate, passionate, but more importantly: consistent, charitable and high integrity. And if someone is your hero, you should take the time to truly internalize their message. In retrospect, Buffet’s message wasn’t that internet companies were scams, it was that any notion of “valuation” had become decoupled from any observable foundation.

My reaction, back in May, was wrong in that it unintentionally ascribed to the “new paradigm” narrative that I have tried to dispel, including in last quarter’s update. Let’s be clear – crypto is a new asset class. It trades on different exchanges from other assets and its [returns are materially uncorrelated](https://coinmetrics.io/correlations/#assets=btc-s&p,btc-gld) from equities such as the S&P 500 or even safe haven Store-of-Values such as gold. But, importantly, that doesn’t mean it’s a “different art.” 

 

Investing is about [entry points and exit points](https://medium.com/first-round-insiders/crystal-balls-vs-calculators-7373c0e09c93), and no difference in “asset class” can substitute for that reality. Entry/exit requires an acute perspective on expected value – upside versus downside – which is a calculus that admittedly got entirely lost during the crypto mania of 2017. Ethereum, the largest smart contracts platform (a global, decentralized database) traded up, touching a $150B market cap, or, for comparison’s sake, roughly the same valuation of the most storied and tested database companies in the world, Oracle and IBM.

Crypto is exciting, but I concede that in spite of some [valiant efforts](https://medium.com/cryptolab/https-medium-com-kalichkin-rethinking-nvt-ratio-2cf810df0ab0), no one really has a clue how to value it. At the same time, it would also be naïve to assume that these platforms do not have any inherent value. Most investors agree that the absolute smartest engineers in the world have and continue to gravitate towards blockchain focused products. Tens of millions of people now own cryptocurrencies and these platforms represent the largest, organically scaled peer-to-peer networks in the history of…humanity? To suggest, as Nouriel Roubini does that these large social movements are the [“mother of all scams”](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/11/roubini-bitcoin-is-mother-of-all-scams.html) and represent no underlying value is patently absurd.

Which seemingly leaves us at an impasse: these new assets ostensibly have value, but it’s functionally impossible to scientifically assess how much. 

It’s a good thing there’s a proven solution for this type of uncertainty: early stage venture capital. 

Traditional early stage venture capital is predicated on a simple proposition: find asymmetrical risk and reward opportunities. These most commonly materialize as risking one times your money for the opportunity to return 25 times that check. The investments Starting Line typically makes, often at $4/6/8/10 million valuations fit this mold. In the vast majority of cases, these businesses are not literally worth their early stage valuations at the time of funding. But those valuations are still a workable function of the opportunity to return many times principal.

As technology proliferates all aspects of the emerging economy, whether that is consumer packaged goods, brick & mortar retail, healthcare, or even crypto, there are an increasing number of asymmetric risk/reward opportunities that may well not look like traditional software bets. I am a strong proponent that if a company’s P&L and velocity of growth appear venture scale (read: high multiple), and my job is to find asymmetric upside opportunities, I should make that investment irrespective of whether the opportunity is in software, CPG or crypto.

Over the past 12 months, valuations in the crypto sector have declined precipitously, with every single major cryptocurrency down [80-99% from their all time highs](https://messari.io/onchainfx/). A few, although by no means all, can credibly fit into this asymmetric framework. For example, a digital currency with a large target market, hundreds of thousands of holders, that has continued to hit product timelines, but which trades at market capitalizations under $10M, very likely has asymmetric upside.

It’s a long way of saying that it’s unclear to me that venture capital funds will continue to generate outsized returns by focusing exclusively on one niche of the broader technology ecosystem. I suspect the best firms will begin to evolve (many, such as a16z, have already begun evolving) to more broadly invest in asymmetric innovation, irrespective of its underlying category.
