## Starting Line Investment Process

There are few more hated phrases amongst entrepreneurs than "our process."

We'll go through our process and get back to you.

Oh will you? It's like a bunch of investors conspired late at night to come up with a universal phrase that meant literally nothing.

We would know too. We heard it as entrepreneurs. We heard it raising this fund; plenty of "process" that was code for: we're just gonna dissapear now pls, thx!

Don't you wish every VC firm was like that Dominos app? Are they topping the pizza or is it in the oven? Out for delivery? Like, what even are the steps? Why is this so hard?

Mark Suster at Upfront Ventures has written some fantastic blogs on the subject: [How to Improve Your Odds of Getting to Yes With a VC](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/how-to-improve-your-odds-of-getting-to-yes-with-a-vc-land-and-expand-b46a0a102a07),[What Really Happens Behind the Scenes at VC Firms](https://www.inc.com/mark-suster/what-really-happens-behind-scenes-at-vc-firms-and-how-to-increase-your-chances-of-landing-a-deal.html), and many more. We love Mark's blogs; but every firm is different.

Here's how our rockcess works.

### The First Meeting

If you reach out to us, either via a cold e-mail or through an introduction, our first touch point is likely to be via an in person meeting or a call. 

We suggest you send us your deck ahead of time, ideally with 24-48 hours notice. We find it uncomfortable when entrepreneurs "pitch" in person. We respect you too much for that. We'd prefer to use our time to learn more about you, what inspires you, what music you like to listen to, and dive into the narrative behind your business in ways that are difficult to accomplish with slides. Some people call this a "conversation." We are all social humans...let's converse and not pitch. 

Some founders are concerned that a deck pre-emptively biases investors one way or another. There is some truth to this. But we can't be experts on every subject and the more information you provide ahead of time, the more work we can do to get smart on your market, ping some of the experts in our network, 

If we reach out to you unprompted, you should expect us to be fully researched on your market, competitors, industry dynamics and more.

### Post Meeting

Post meeting is where communication becomes complicated between founders and investors. It's this weird purgatory where both sides hope the other side is doing *something* but that something is substantially undefined.

If you like Starting Line enough that you'd like to keep chatting with us, and we feel similarly, we'd encourage you to share as much information with us as you feel comfortable with.

Our post meeting commitment is as follows:
* Review any materials you've sent over and respond within a week (unless we agree otherwise)
* Provide an indication of interest or not within a week (unless we agree otherwise)
* Share a list of value additive/strategic contacts that exist in our network within 10 days (unless we otherwise agree)
