## Starting Line Investment Process

There are few more hated phrases amongst entrepreneurs than "our process."

We'll go through our process and get back to you.

It's like a bunch of investors conspired late at night to come up with a universal phrase that was a catch all to mean literally nothing.

We would know too. We heard it as entrepreneurs. We heard it raising this fund; plenty of "process" that was code for: we're just gonna dissapear now pls, thx!

Don't you wish every VC firm was like that Dominos app? Are they topping the pizza or is it in the oven? Out for delivery? Like, what even are the steps? Why is this so hard?

Mark Suster at Upfront Ventures has written some fantastic blogs on the subject: [How to Improve Your Odds of Getting to Yes With a VC](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/how-to-improve-your-odds-of-getting-to-yes-with-a-vc-land-and-expand-b46a0a102a07),[What Really Happens Behind the Scenes at VC Firms](https://www.inc.com/mark-suster/what-really-happens-behind-scenes-at-vc-firms-and-how-to-increase-your-chances-of-landing-a-deal.html), and many more. We love Mark's blogs; but every firm is different.

Here's how our rockcess works.

### The First Meeting

If you reach out to us, either via a cold e-mail or through an introduction, our first touch point is likely to be via an in person meeting or a call. 

We suggest you send us your deck ahead of time, ideally with 24-48 hours notice. We find it uncomfortable when entrepreneurs "pitch" in person. We respect you too much for that. We'd prefer to use our time to learn more about you, what inspires you, what music you like to listen to, and dive into the narrative behind your business in ways that are difficult to accomplish with slides. Some people call this a "conversation." We are all social humans...let's converse and not pitch. 

Some founders are concerned that a deck pre-emptively biases investors one way or another. There is some truth to this. But we can't be experts on every subject and the more information you provide ahead of time, the more work we can do to get smart on your market, ping some of the experts in our network, 

If we reach out to you unprompted, you should expect us to be fully researched on your market, competitors, industry dynamics and more.

### Post Meeting

Post meeting is where communication becomes complicated between founders and investors. It's this weird purgatory where both sides hope the other side is doing *something* but that something is substantially undefined.

If you like Starting Line enough that you'd like to keep chatting with us, and we feel similarly, we'd encourage you to share as much information with us as you feel comfortable with.

Our post meeting commitment is as follows:
* Review any materials you've sent over and respond within a week (unless we agree otherwise)
* Provide an indication of interest or not within a week (unless we agree otherwise)
* Share a list of value additive/strategic contacts that exist in our network within 10 days (unless we otherwise agree)

### Diligence

We do diligence in many different ways, some of which are quantitative and some of which are qualitative. Things we may do behind the scenes include:
1. Perform personal references through our mutual networks.
2. Connect with people we respect at companies where you've previously been employed and ask about your reputation, cultural fit, and work ethic. (If you've only ever been a CEO, we may reach out to former employees).
3. Forward your deck to non-competitive experts who can help us validate certain assumptions as well as better define areas to investigate.
4. Investigate through our network on the performance of competitive businesses, without revealing details about yours.
5. Interview current and prospective customers.
6. Commission proprietary research and/or polling on your market and narrative. We enjoy working with [Survata](https://www.survata.com/) but they are not the only research platform we leverage.
7. Use your product and stress-test it.
8. Request prior monthly investor updates.
9. Review all applicable financials including a forward looking pro-forma, your trailing metrics, and guage feedback from marketing, product, supply chain, etc, experts on your assumptions.

Timelines from first meeting to term sheet have historically ranged from 2 weeks to several months. 

**If any of these diligence items make you uncomfortable - including your deck being forwarded or references being contacted - please let us know ahead of time; we will respect your wishes. However, being prevented from appropriately diligencing a business in the manner we consider optimal renders it unlikely, if not impossible, that we could make an investment.**

A lot of entrepreneurs ask us how we stack rank the variables we are listening for throughout the diligence process. We admit that it is an imperfent science but it breaks down roughly across the following rubric of prioritization:
1. Integrity of founding team
2. Cohesion of go big narrative
3. Affinity with the product (ours, not yours)
4. Ability of founding team to raise additional capital.
5. Exciting market dynamics (connected with #2, narrative).
6. Positive employee feedback
7. Experience of management team

### Investment Decisions

We elect to invest in a business when we have an unwavering level of conviction, either around the founding team or the product being brought to market, and ideally both.

General pre-requisites for issuing a term sheet include:
1. Multiple meetings with Starting Line, either in person or on the phone.
2. Company's engagement with our network of advisors and experts.
3. Many hours collaboratively spent investigating Company pro-formas and existing metrics. Although an imperfect science, this is often 6-10 hours in aggregate.
4. Discussions with many, if not all, prior investors of the business.
5. On site Company meeting to meet the breadth of the team.
6. Time spent socially outside of a work environment to better gauge each others' values.
7. Deep dive into product roadmap and R&D, understanding the timelines and levers that give your Company the opportunity to increase its velocity.
8. Introductions to other founders in Starting Line's portfolio or that we've worked with in the past as investors.

As our average check is $1M, we also work closely with the Company to ensure there is sufficient financing leverage elsewhere in a potential syndicate to provide the firepower necessary to prove out future milestones.

Our firm, like many others, has considerations that are outside an entrepreneurs control such as: duration into a fund cycle, historical biases from similar businesses, competitive sensitivities, partner dynamics and more. 

If we spend more than a few hours with your business and do not invest, we commit ourselves to providing substantial feedback about our rationale.

### Term Sheets

At Starting Line, we try to issue no frills, market standard term sheets that allow you to build your company on fair, non-punitive terms and work through the docs process quickly.

A sample of our default term sheet can be: [found here](https://github.com/startinglinevc/Overview/blob/master/Starting%20Line%20-%20Sample%20Termsheet.pdf)

Though there will often be minor adaptations to the sample term sheet, the core of the offer will remain consistent.
