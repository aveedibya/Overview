# Starting Line Operating Manual
This document exists because we recognize that entrepreneurs struggle to both properly understand and connect with prospective investors. Our dream is that this manual provides all the information you could possibly want to know about us; and we will continually update it to fill in holes that are discovered.

This operating manual was inspired by our friends at Bloomberg Beta (one of our first investors) who are also committed to radical transparency.
