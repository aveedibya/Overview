# Starting Line Operating Manual
This document exists because we recognize that entrepreneurs struggle to both properly understand and connect with prospective investors. Our dream is that this manual provides all the information you could possibly want to know about us; and we will continually update it to fill in holes that are discovered.

This operating manual was inspired by our friends at Bloomberg Beta (one of our first investors) who are also committed to radical transparency.

## What We Invest In 
Starting Line is a thematic early stage venture capital fund focused on investing in consumer services and products that are both cheaper and better.

We, like many Americans, were struck by the November 2016 elections and it was one of the inspirations behind the founding of this platform. Technology has the potential to democratize access to information, wealth and opportunity; however, over the past decade, the gap between the 1% and the 99% has widened substantially. We invest where we see opportunities to make products and services available to a broad range of Americans - not build incremental services for the affluent.

We do not invest in enterprise software nor affluence or luxury focused products (unless they are substantially more affordable than their peers).

## The Checks We Write
We are a first check venture capital fund, meaning that we aim to anchor true seed rounds with check sizes ranging from $750,000 - $1,2500,000 in rounds ranging from $1 - $5M.

Our fund is unique in that we reserve very little money for follow-ons into future rounds. We are blessed with a risk tolerant group of LPs who have approved a fund structure whereby we invest 80% of our capital up front into first checks and reserve only 20% for follow-ons. We guarantee each investment we seed a follow-on check of $100,000 irrespective of progress or next round size.

We believe this unorthodox structure is beneficial for early stage founders for a variety of reasons:
1. It allows founders & investors to be deeply aligned across a spectrum of goals and outcomes. We are both fighting for the same oxygen in future rounds.
2. It generates a strong market signal given that Starting Line only makes ~5-6 new investments per year. (We do not buy "options.")
3. It removes any negative market signaling from future financings.
4. It allows founders to more quickly close their seed rounds and get back to build their business - rather than spending months accumulating a series of smaller checks.

## Geographic Focus
Starting Line is HQ'd in Chicago, IL and we are highly biased towards our hometown of Chicago and underserved areas between the coasts. However, we have no formal geographic policy - and instead are inspired by founders aiming to solve problems for average, everyday Americans.
